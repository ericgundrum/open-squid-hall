"""## SquidSpace.js Serve Command

The SquidSpace.js 'serve' command creates a web server for static files in the 
current working directory using the address 'http://localhost:8000/'. The server
will run until you force it to quit by pressing 'ctrl-C'.

For more information on SquidSpace.js, please refer to the documentation 
located in the project repo at https://github.com/jackwilliambell/SquidSpace.js"""
